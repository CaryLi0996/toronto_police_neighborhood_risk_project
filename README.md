Predicting Various Risk Factors in the Toronto Neighborhoods: Project Overview
==============================================================================

* Objective: By analyzing the three datasets collected from the open Toronto portal, one can accurately predict what, when, and where different crimes and accidents will be likely to happen in neighborhoods in the Toronto area. This can effectively help the Toronto Police department to automate their task force scheduling by delegating police patrols efficiently; sending out the right amount of help to people at the right time, and most importantly, taking the active precautions to prevent crimes from happening.
